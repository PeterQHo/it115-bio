Go back to Heather's video and see if we can get more tips like:

1) Identify your audience (Classmates)
2) Create a powerful first sentence (solve a pain point) (Joining YearUp)
3) Tell a compelling story (Experiences from worki)
4) Call of action (Connecting with others)
5) End with personality

Hello, my name is Peter Ho, I am currently working toward a certificate to gain experience with working in application development at year up where they are bridging the gap between real work experience and education. I have worked in retail and wanted to create a path for me to get into the tech industry. My experiences have gave me the  ability to adapt to fast-paced environments and to communicate better with others. My goal is to gain the technical ability to create a path for me to get a job in the tech industry. I hope to be able to gain the skill to transition into game development. I invite everyone to connect with me on LinkedIn if they are interested in learning more about myself or my experiences.
